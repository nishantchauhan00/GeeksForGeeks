An optimization:
1) As an even number greater than 2 can't be prime, so we can skip them or have
   an incrementer of 2 instead of 1, put condition for even number greater than
   2 before
2) Instead of checking till n, we can check till âˆšn because a larger factor of 
   n must be a multiple of smaller factor that has been already checked.
